## MISSION

 Omhmtimize strives to create a streamlined learning experience for modern society. The difficulty of learning a new
subject can be a huge deterent. Compounding the frustration of learning newsubjects, the overwhelming lack of valid
or sufficient resources form a hostile enviroment. Here at OMHM, we are constantly developing a model of human
learning in an effort to make learning less frightnening and possible for the global community. By vigorously striving to
source only the most relavant and accurate data as well as continually working to perfect the academic paradigm, we
hope to one day leave no corner of the globe in the dark.
     

Omhmtimize strives to: 
   > Create an open source communal learning enviroment where all can come to seek knowledge
   > Create a platform for intellectuals to share expertise and experience globally in an effort to educate the unfortunates unable recieve adaquete education. 
   > Document and classify learning methods in an effort to implement the most efficient lesson style for each individual learner. 
   > Create a paradigm that can be used to automate the learning process 
   > Analyze academic material for accuracy and content then compile content into the most effective format for the learner
